## How to change the status of the order after payment

### Who will be interested
If you are looking for why your Woo store order statuses after payment with this plugin are set to Completed, this is the place for you.

### Overview
How to change the automatic switching of an order to the “processing” status instead of the “completed” status after a successful payment by a customer.
As you know from the WooCommerce documentation, by default, the order status after successful payment should be set from Pending to Processing. But this does not happen. Instead, after a successful payment, the order status is changed from Pending to Completed.

>By default, WooCommerce will only auto-complete paid orders for products that are both Virtual and Downloadable, assuming that the shop needs to fulfill/ship any orders that don’t meet these criteria.

### Why this is so
It's impossible to provide convenience for both types of products (completed for virtual and processing for physical), so plugin sets best one.

This is convenient (i.e. Order Autocomplete) for virtual goods, because they do not have any stages of order fulfillment and delivery. 
So this is not a bug, but rather a feature for virtual goods. 
> Although, in terms of following the best practices specified in the WooCommerce documentation, this somehow modifies the standard WooCommerce store order lifecycle. And this can logically interfere with the implementation of other plugins for physical goods.

### What to do for stores with physical goods
Since the plugin doesn't offer any settings in this regard in the admin panel, we have to make some changes to its code manually.
We need to find the `set_status()` function in the plugin code. The code looks like this:

```php
$order->set_status(“wc-completed”);
```

the string value “wc-completed” is to be replaced with “wc-processing”.
As a result, the line in the plugin code will look like this:				
```php
$order->set_status(“wc-processing”);
```

### Tested in Practice
As a reference example, IoT-devices, LLC have tested the above changes on their store in production 
https://go.iot-devices.com.ua/shop
and it works fine
